importance of providing a secure environment for them. We have adopted a company-wide On-Line Privacy Policy (&ldquo;Privacy Policy&rdquo;) that explains how we collect, store, and use the information you provide us. This Privacy Policy details how NGames safeguards the privacy of its on-line visitors and does not apply to information that may be collected by NGames off-line. Please note that when you click a link to other sites from a NGames website, this Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities on, those other sites. We highly recommend that you read the privacy policy of any third party website you may be directed to before providing any personally identifiable information.</p>\n<p>This Privacy Policy and the certification seals shown on our websites confirm that NGames is a valid licensee, and participating member, in good standing of the&nbsp;Entertainment Software Rating Board&#39;s Privacy Certified Program&nbsp;(&ldquo;ESRB Privacy Certified&rdquo;). ESRB Privacy Certified is designed to ensure that our information collection, use and disclosure practices are responsible and appropriate. To protect your privacy, we have voluntarily undertaken this privacy initiative, and all of our websites where this Privacy Policy is posted have been reviewed and certified by ESRB Privacy Certified to meet established online information collection, use and disclosure practices.</p>\n<p>By using this website and/or any of NGames&rsquo;s online products or services, you signify your assent to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy, please do not use our websites. This Privacy Policy may change from time to time, so please check back periodically to ensure that you are aware of any changes. If we make a material change to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by posting the change on our websites or in this Privacy Policy and, if necessary, give you additional choices regarding such change prior to the change becoming effective. Your continued use of the NGames websites will signify your acceptance of these changes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>1. What personal information is collected?</strong></p>\n<p>If an on-line visitor submits information to NGames, it will usually take the form of either: (1) the purchase of goods or services though our on-line stores, (2) product or account registration, or registration for on-line game participation, (3) message boards or forums,(4) contest registrations, (5) a consumer complaint, (6) surveys, (7) customer service or technical support, Personal information collected may include your IP, phone number, and/or e-mail address. We do not require this information to gain access to our websites, however, you will not be able to utilize certain products, services, or features that require registration or receive materials such as newsletters unless such information is provided.</p>\n<p>If you register an account using your Facebook account, the following information may be collected: (1) your first and last name and other information made publicly available by you, (2) your friends list, and (3) the email address associated with your account.</p>\n<p>Some of our websites and/or online services require you to create an account with a third party service provider. For example, users are required to create a Gamesamba ID in order to use our cooperate game website. The username and email address that you create through this platform are collected by both NGames and Gamesamba. In these types of instances, we strongly encourage you to also review the privacy practices of the third party prior to divulging any personal information.</p>\n<p>Visitors purchasing products or services will be required to provide additional information such as a valid credit card number, expiration date, and shipping and billing addresses.</p>\n<p>Please note that, depending on the NGames website that you are visiting, many of the activities listed above may not be available and, as such, personal information may not be collected.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2. What other types of information may we collect?</strong></p>\n<p>For some activities, we may ask you to create a username and password and/or to provide other personal and non-personal information including but not limited to your age, date of birth, gender, and/or game and platform preferences; and, we may combine such information with other personal and/or non-personal information. In addition, your web browser or client software may transmit certain geographic information or information regarding your computer (capabilities, game data processing, etc.) to NGames. NGames may use this information to generate aggregate statistics about our user community and may provide such information to advertisers and/or our partners. In addition, NGames may use such information for security, system integrity (the prevention of hacking, cheats, etc.), or enforcement purposes. From time to time, we may also post customer testimonials that contain personally identifiable information on NGames&rsquo;s websites. However, we will obtain the customer&rsquo;s consent to post these testimonials prior to publication in accordance with the applicable NGames agreement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>3. How do we use your personal information?</strong></p>\n<p>The personal information you provide NGames will allow us to fulfill your product or service order; alert you of new products or services, features, or enhancements; handle/route your customer service or technical support questions or issues; to send eCards or &ldquo;Recruit-a-Friend&rdquo; emails; and/or notify you of upgrade opportunities, contests, promotions, or special events and offers. NGames may enhance or merge the personal information collected at a NGames website with data from third parties in order to update your contact information, perform market analysis, or improve our products, services, or systems. NGames may also provide your personal information to other companies or organizations that offer products or services that may be of interest to you. In such cases, we will notify you that the information will be shared and provide you with an opportunity to opt-out.</p>\n<p>Lastly, we may use your personal information for internal marketing, profiling, or demographic purposes, so we can adapt our products and services to better suit your needs. We do this to better understand and serve our customers.</p>\n<p>Please be advised that personal information submitted by individuals acting solely in a business capacity (e.g., personal information contained in job applicant&#39;s resume) is not subject to the uses set forth above or to any other practices stated in this Privacy Policy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>4. What type of communications may you receive?</strong></p>\n<p>Special Offers and Updates</p>\n<p>We will occasionally send you information on products, services, special deals, and promotions. Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the &ldquo;Choice&rdquo; section below.</p>\n<p>Service-related Announcements</p>\n<p>We will send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if our service is temporarily suspended for maintenance, we might send you an email. Generally, you may not opt-out of these communications, which are not promotional in nature.</p>\n<p>Customer Service</p>\n<p>Based upon the personally identifiable information you provide us, we will send you a welcoming email to verify your username and password. We will also communicate with you in response to your inquiries, to provide the services you request, and to manage your account. We will communicate with you by email or telephone, in accordance with your wishes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>5. Who is collecting your information?</strong></p>\n<p>When you are asked for information while on a NGames website, you are sharing that information with NGames, its parent, and its various affiliates and sister companies, unless specifically stated otherwise. As a result of this sharing, you may receive communications from any of NGames&#39;s affiliates. From time to time, NGames may use third party contractors to collect and process personal information on its behalf (for product and prize fulfillment, credit card processing, etc.).</p>\n<p>In addition, some services are provided in conjunction with partner companies. If your personal information is being collected by a company other than NGames and not on NGames&rsquo;s behalf, you will be notified at the time the information is collected. If you do not want your information shared, you can choose not to allow the transfer of information by not using that particular service or by not providing any information at that time.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that we cannot control the activities of third parties to whom we provide data, and while we cannot guarantee that they adhere to the same privacy and security procedures as NGames, we will take reasonable steps to assure that these third parties will provide sufficient protection of personal information.</p>\n<p>Please be aware that advertisers or websites with links to and from our websites may collect personal information about you. And remember, this Privacy Policy does not apply to, and cannot control the activities of, those other advertisers or websites. We encourage you to carefully read the privacy policy of any advertiser or website you visit.</p>\n<p>Our websites may include certain social media features such as the Facebook &quot;Like&quot; button, and widgets such as the Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on our websites. These features may collect your Internet Protocol (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) address, which page you are visiting on our websites, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on our websites. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>6. With whom may your personal information be shared?</strong></p>\n<p>NGames will share your personal information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties. We may, however, share non-personally identifiable, aggregated, and/or public information with third parties. Additionally, we share unique identifiers specific to your device with third parties for the purpose of tailoring content as well as personalizing, adjusting and improving our services.</p>\n<p>We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law or in special cases when we have reason to believe that disclosing such information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against you if you are violating the Terms of Service or Use Agreements for a NGames website or product, or may be causing injury to or interference (intentionally or unintentionally) with NGames&#39;s rights or property, other users of a NGames website or product, or anyone else who could be harmed by your activities. We also reserve the right to disclose your personal information if we have a good faith belief that it is necessary to prevent fraud or other illegal activities.</p>\n<p>As with any business, your personal information is also an asset of NGames and will become part of our normal business records. As such, we may also disclose your personal information to a third party if we decide to sell a line of business to that third party, so you can continue to receive service and information in connection with that line of business with as little disruption as possible. Similarly, in the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other similar event, your personal information may be transferred to NGames&#39;s successor or assign.</p>\n<p>NGames websites may also have message boards, forums, and/or chat areas, where users can exchange ideas and communicate with one another. When posting to a message board, forum, or chat area, please be aware that the information is being made publicly available on-line and the user does so at his or her own risk. For certain forums, anyone posting or replying to a post may be doing so using their Real ID -- that is, their full first and last name -- with the option to also display the name of their primary in-game character (see discussion regarding Real ID below). If your personal information is posted on one of our community forums, you may contact us at&nbsp;<a href=\"/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection\" class=\"__cf_email__\" data-cfemail=\"e090928996818399a08e87818d8593ce838f8d\">[email&#160;protected]</a>&nbsp;to request removal. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>7. What choices do you have regarding the collection, use, and distribution of your personal information?</strong></p>\n<p>NGames allows you to control the way that we use personally identifying information that we might obtain. At the time you provide personal information, NGames may give you the option of declining any future offers or information about new products, promotions, or services. In addition, many of the &quot;mailings&quot; NGames may send you, such as newsletters, have procedures within them to cancel the receipt of any future mailings. Lastly, you may be given the opportunity to &quot;opt-out&quot; of certain features or functionality (e.g. Real ID).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>8. What about Children?</strong></p>\n<p>We recognize a special obligation to protect personal information about young children. We urge parents to instruct their children to never give out their real names, addresses, or phone numbers, without permission, when on-line. Teenagers under the age of 17 and over the age of 12 should encourage their parents to review this policy and to contact us if they would like to evoke our opt-out policy or to raise any concerns.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>9. What are tracking technologies and how are they used?</strong></p>\n<p>As is true with most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information may include a unique identifier such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and non-personal information such as your browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and/or clickstream data. We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you.

We may combine this automatically collected log information with other information we collect about you. We do this to improve the services we offer you, to improve marketing, analytics, or website functionality.</p>\n<p>NGames may use tracking technologies such as cookies, beacons, tags and scripts.

If you wish to not have your information used for the purpose of serving you targeted ads, you may opt-out by&nbsp;visiting the&nbsp;DAA&#39;s Consumer Choice page&nbsp;and/or the&nbsp;NAI&rsquo;s Consumer Opt-Out page.

Please also note that we strive to adhere to the&nbsp;DAA&#39;s Self-Regulatory Principles for Online Behavioral Advertising.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>10. What are Internet Protocol addresses?</strong></p>\n<p>An Internet Protocol (&quot;IP&quot;) address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider (&quot;ISP&quot;). NGames may track such IP addresses for system administration, to report aggregate information, site tracking, security purposes, or to prevent our servers from being abused. See tracking technology discussion above.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>11.
