If the text of\r\n   - an error's message is \"too small\", specifically\r\n   - less than 512 bytes, Internet Explorer returns\r\n   - its own error message. You can turn that off,\r\n   - but it's pretty tricky to find switch called\r\n   - \"smart error messages\". That means, of course,\r\n   - that short error messages are censored by default.\r\n   - IIS always returns error messages that are long\r\n   - enough to make Internet Explorer happy. The\r\n   - workaround is pretty simple: pad the error\r\n   - message with a big comment like this to push it\r\n   - over the five hundred and twelve bytes minimum.\r\n   - Of course, that's exactly what you're reading\r\n   - right now.\r\n   -->\r\n"
