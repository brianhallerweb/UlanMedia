If the text of\n   - an error's message is \"too small\", specifically\n   - less than 512 bytes, Internet Explorer returns\n   - its own error message. You can turn that off,\n   - but it's pretty tricky to find switch called\n   - \"smart error messages\". That means, of course,\n   - that short error messages are censored by default.\n   - IIS always returns error messages that are long\n   - enough to make Internet Explorer happy. The\n   - workaround is pretty simple: pad the error\n   - message with a big comment like this to push it\n   - over the five hundred and twelve bytes minimum.\n   - Of course, that's exactly what you're reading\n   - right now.\n   -->\n"
