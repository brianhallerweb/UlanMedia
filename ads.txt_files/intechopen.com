Entrepreneurs have the ability to spot opportunities in the market where some people will see issues or problems. This in turn helps individuals with a high entrepreneurial propensity to transform and change their communities and economies (Makura, 2008). One of the most interesting places where an untapped potential of entrepreneurial spirit exists is in Africa, and Southern Africa in particular, which is blessed with an untamed nature and abundant natural resources. Namibia, the country on which this chapter is based, amazes the author through the incredible energy, determination and perseverance coming from the people when talking about entrepreneurship. The best way to harness and make use of these abundant resources is through entrepreneurial education &ndash; in particular our youth, who are regarded as the leaders of tomorrow. A massive opportunity lies ahead in Namibia for young people and those who are willing and able to follow their footsteps. Entrepreneurship should not be just about making money or acquiring wealth, but should be seen as a unique opportunity to uplift the nation and communities at a grassroots level. This brings us to the definition of entrepreneurship:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p id=\"P6\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<em>In the international literature &lsquo;entrepreneurship&rsquo; is derived from the French verb &lsquo;entreprendre&rsquo; which means to take your bare hands and do something. Each person has the ability to make something from nothing, and the education aspect of entrepreneurship can be both formal and informal.</em>\\n\\t\\t\\t</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p id=\"P7\"><em>Entrepreneurship in the Namibian context can be defined as the efforts made by a particular individual in a community or a society in accumulating the necessary resources to benefit the community</em> (<a href=\"#B2\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">April, 2009</a>).</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p id=\"P8\">This chapter will first give an account of the background of the Republic of Namibia. A detailed analysis of the before and after independence education systems in Namibia will be outlined, followed by a look into the spirit of entrepreneurial education in Namibia. This chapter will highlight some key initiatives and directives that Namibia has in terms of the nation&rsquo;s Vision 2030. In addition, the research methods will be discussed and an account will be given on conclusions and future research recommendations.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\"section\" id=\"sec_2\" data-lvl=\"1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<h2 class=\"heading main-title\">2. Background on the Republic of Namibia</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p id=\"P9\">The Republic of Namibia is situated on the southwestern coast of Africa, and was formally known as Sud West Africa. The Namib Desert is one of the oldest deserts in the world, running across the coastline, except for the northernmost Kaokoveld. Namibia, which borders the north with Angola, South Africa to the south and Botswana to the east. Namibia is home to the most ancient nations on Earth, the !Khung (!- Indicates the click sound), members of the Khoisan people (H. Witbooi, personal communication, 15 August 2008). The Europeans used to call these people Bushmen (meaning people who reside or live in the Bush). Very few of these people are still alive today, except in the far northern parts of Namibia and in the Kalahari Desert. The traditional or informal education of these people is largely oral tradition. These communities have deeply rooted cultural values, mostly in terms of honesty, and nobody will use water or food that another person has stored in ostrich eggshells and buried in the sand. These people have deeply embedded entrepreneurial skills, as they are risk takers and use the limited resources at their disposal to make a living.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p id=\"preF1\">By around 1000 A.D. the indigenous people of Namibia gave way to the various Migrating Bantu speaking people who later made Namibia their home. By the 1800s a reasonable number of Herero and Owambo people moved southwards to Namibia. The mid-1800s witnessed the arrival of the missionaries and soldiers, who settled mostly in the coastal regions. The &lsquo;<em>Iron Chancellor&rsquo;</em> Otto von Bismarck declared <em>&lsquo;My Map of Africa lies in Europe&rsquo;</em> when he convened the Berlin conference at which European powers were searching for new markets and coveting the riches of Africa. The continent was divided into regions and national boundaries. Together with Togo, Kamerun (which with Togo was split between Britain and France after World War I and is today known as Cameroon), German East Africa (after World War I, Tanganyika, known since independence as Tanzania, was mandated to Britain and Ruanda- Urundi to Belgium) and German South West Africa (today known as Namibia) became German property (See Figure:1 for colonies). This colonial past has an impact on the way in which education, both formal and informal, is perceived in Namibia.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<figure class=\"media-panel\" id=\"F1\"><div class=\"media\"><img src=\"/media/chapter/47638/media/image1.png\" class=\"figure-link\" alt=\"\"></div><figcaption class=\"caption\"><h4>Figure 1.</h4><p>Map of Africa illustrating some colonies (Cameroon, Tanzania and Namibia)</p></figcaption></figure>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p id=\"posleF1\">In 1915, during World War I, South Africa allied with the British and took over South West Africa. The initial intention of South Africa was to annex the country, but this was prevented by the League of Nations, which gave South Africa the authority to manage Namibia&rsquo;s government and affairs. In 1945, after World War II, the United Nations, which replaced the League of Nations, requested that South West Africa be placed under United Nations trusteeship. South Africa refused, and guerrilla warfare led to the establishment of the South West Africa People&rsquo;s Organization (SWAPO). On March 21, 1990 Namibia became an independent nation. The next section of the chapter will look at Namibia&rsquo;s education systems before and after independence.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\"section\" id=\"sec_3\" data-lvl=\"1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<h2 class=\"heading main-title\">3. Namibia&rsquo;s pre-post independence education systems</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p id=\"P13\">Education for Africans in Namibia went through three successive phases prior to independence, and the fourth stage took shape after independence in 1990. In this section of this chapter we will have a closer look at the three phases prior to independence and the fourth phase after independence. These phases are pre-Bantu education before 1962, Bantu education from 1962-1976, and post-Bantu education from 1977 onwards. All of these phases were accompanied by a general pattern of political and social economic changes of the inhabitants of this country. Each phase was clearly influenced by the political situation in Namibia at that particular point in time.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p id=\"P14\">Prior to Namibian independence, education in Africa existed in both formal and informal manners. Informal learning usually took place through observation: the younger generations observed what the elders, older siblings or older members within a community were doing. In terms of informal learning we draw upon the great works of Paul Freire, a Brazilian educationist who has contributed significant thought on progressive practice. Freire&rsquo;s thought was more on informal thinking and education, and he viewed informal learning as conversational rather than curricular. Informal learning, especially in terms of business, will allow people to work together rather than working against one another. This could allow people to see entrepreneurship as a partnership in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Although it might be controversial, Freire argued too much formal education to be like a banking deposit. It could be argued that the educationist is making banking deposits to the educatee. It was also the notion of Freire that dialogue can be viewed as a means of creating a deeper understanding and difference in the world. The views of Freire support the notion that, for entrepreneurial education to foster and grow in developing economies like Namibia, a dialogue is critical as it can enhance the community and build social capital. An informal educator, according to the work of Freire, is about action. This does not imply that the formal educational aspect does not take action into consideration. The formal aspect, on the other hand, is institutionalized education, and carefully planned education programmes. It is important to highlight in this chapter that, prior to the introduction of Western educational philosophies, education in Africa (Namibia) existed in one form or another. It would be wrong to argue that the early formal pioneers moved in a complete educational vacuum. Every society is believed to have their own education system, if only to the extent that it is its concern and beliefs that give it an identity and preserve its existence (<a href=\"#B1\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">Amukugo, 1993</a>).</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p id=\"P15\">It is the general assumption and belief of some scholars that education was not solely introduced through colonization (<a href=\"#B1\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">Amukugo, 1993</a>). In 1980, the National Education Act No. 30 replaced the South African Bantu Education Act, No. 47 of 1953. The primary aim of the Namibian Education Act was to create three more bodies. The National Examination Board for South West Africa was then created to prescribe the minimum standards for courses and syllabi to oversee examinations. It is important to highlight that the education systems had race-based examinations administered under different departments (Bantu, coloured and white). The apartheid system played an instrumental role in maintaining social stratification. During the colonial period certain subjects in schools were only available for whites, such as computer studies and mathematics. The coloureds were fortunate to take accountancy and typing, while the blacks were only allowed to take home economics and needlework. In many instances during the apartheid era, educational and occupational roles usually corresponded to one&rsquo;s economic, and then social status, in society. Thus, by virtue of the level of education the disadvantaged black majority in Namibia could receive, it was clear that the type of jobs they held caused them to remain members of the lowest class (J. Rodrickson, personal communication, 15 July 2014).</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p id=\"P16\">After independence, the Republic of Namibia introduced entrepreneurial education in primary and secondary schools, with the primary aim of helping to reduce unemployment in Namibia. The intention was to ensure that Namibians were well equipped with the essential skills and knowledge of how to start a business, if they desired, once they completed school. All young pupils in primary schools in Namibia are required to study social science courses that have a strong entrepreneurial component. Entrepreneurship is taught as a module from grade 8 to 12 and all students are introduced to basic entrepreneurial skills and principles. Another role of entrepreneurial education is to give Namibians access to the labour market and to enable communities to survive. The Republic of Namibia has definitely made progress in terms of entrepreneurial education after independence. Particularly in terms of quantity, Namibia has to improve a lot and a number of entrepreneurial centres where citizens, young and old, can learn how to start a business of their own have been introduced in Namibia. The next section of this chapter will look at the spirit of entrepreneurial education in Namibia.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\"section\" id=\"sec_4\" data-lvl=\"1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<h2 class=\"heading main-title\">4. The spirit of entrepreneurial education in Namibia with reference to Vision 2030</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p id=\"P17\">Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make up an important part of the Namibian economy. SMEs contribute 12% to the Namibian GDP and employ an estimated one fifth of the workforce. To ensure that Namibia reached its goals of Vision 2030 a number of entrepreneurial programmes have been introduced in the country. These programmes are catered for in both formal and informal ways. The formal programmes constitute the official introduction of entrepreneurship at a secondary school level, where students can bridge to start or set up a business of their own after their high school career. There are also vocational training centres where Namibians get a first-hand opportunity to upgrade their entrepreneurial skills to start a business venture of their own.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p id=\"P18\">Fostering entrepreneurial education in any economy is critical as it will lead to creative manpower and a successful workforce with better skills to meet the demand of the economy. It is the argument of the author that the major obstacle for growth in developing economies such as the Republic of Namibia is a lack of educated entrepreneurs who are able to mobilize and coordinate production inputs. Financial institutions cannot afford to lend money to uneducated or uninformed entrepreneurs as it will seem as if they are throwing money away or making a negative investment. It is the viewpoint of the author that it is not only financial skills which are lacking, but also general knowledge, ability and skills that entrepreneurs need to possess in today&rsquo;s competitive global market. This can also take us back to the scholarly argument as to whether entrepreneurs are born or bred &ndash; with genetic and environmental conditions that could make them destined for entrepreneurship. However, Kent (1990) has put succinctly that education can make a difference to the supply of entrepreneurs in developing economies such as Namibia. This view is slightly different from the views of Freire (1997) when we look at informal education.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p id=\"P19\">The study of entrepreneurial education around the world is still in its infancy (Brazael and Herbert 1999). In a similar view, Namibia as a nation has only recently started to introduce entrepreneurial education across the various sectors of the economy. However, if Namibia as an economy aspires to become competitive in the African market and around the globe, entrepreneurship is a viable option. <a href=\"#B3\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">Brockhaus (2001</a>) noted that the first course in entrepreneurship was introduced in 1957 at the Harvard Business School. Drucker also taught another course at New York University in 1953. Surprisingly it was only during the last two decades that entrepreneurship has been formally introduced in academia for example, the Babson School of Entrepreneurship in Babson, Massachusetts. The first doctor of philosophy graduates in entrepreneurship emerged in 1981 in the USA at Babson. It is possible to agree with <a href=\"#B6\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">Timmons (1988</a>) that entrepreneurship is also about the ability to create something from nothing. It is also about initiating, doing and achieving, and goes beyond just watching the creation of a new venture by establishing a business in the practical sense. Entrepreneurship education can have a strong bearing on the development of entrepreneurs in Namibia. Namibia has set up various centres such as the Namibian Business and Innovation Centre to help with the grooming of entrepreneurs in Namibia. The University of Namibia and the Polytechnic of Namibia offers entrepreneurship as a course, but have not established standalone degree programmes. There are also entrepreneurial training courses offered at accredited smaller training institutions in Namibia. The teaching of entrepreneurship in Namibian tertiary institutions is critical as it can be seen as a response to overcome the legacy and educational systems of the colonial past. It is also a move to stimulate entrepreneurial thinking amongst Namibian citizens.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p id=\"P20\">A number of activities have recently been undertaken in order to stimulate the growth of the SMEs in Namibia. This support is usually in managerial and financial form to train people to become entrepreneurs. Namibia has a policy on small business development. in the early 2000s it appeared that the net growth by jobs created and lost was more positive in the economic clusters of body care, healthcare, hospitality, tourism and crafts, and much less in the electronics, manufacturing and consulting sectors. After been trained in the entrepreneurial sectors, most entrepreneurs prefer to work in hospitality and tourism. They prefer this because these businesses are relatively easy to enter and they try to avoid risks. This reveals that some Namibians are moderate risk takers. However, these jobs require less innovation. Some of the core reasons as to why entrepreneurs do this are a result of their personal characteristics. A lack of psychological success factors and a lack of desire to take initiative in the decision-making process is also a hindrance to some Namibian entrepreneurs. When the author looks at Namibian people, entrepreneurial development can be predicted on three levels. Entrepreneurial education in Namibia should enable the citizens of the country to develop certain technical skills that they would like to exploit as self-sustaining entrepreneurs, but might not have the entrepreneurial skills and they might develop a sense and an aspiration for entrepreneurship. Some of them might develop an entrepreneurial attitude and behave accordingly. In Namibia most entrepreneurs have to be trained in crafts, and more so in entrepreneurial skills such as marketing, record keeping, and employee personnel, among others. All organizations in Namibia play different roles in the development of the economy; for example the Centre of Entrepreneurial Development (CED) at the Polytechnic of Namibia. A major challenge for upcoming entrepreneurs in Namibia is the change of mindset from having skills to becoming a competent entrepreneur. This will require a lot of input from all stakeholders. In addition, local banks in Namibia such as Bank Windhoek are providing mentor skills training this regard, and there are a number of consulting firms providing similar services. Training mentors enables help people to become self-reliant and independent entrepreneurs and self-sustaining business people who might eventually start their own businesses. According to the <a href=\"#B5\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">NIED Report (2006</a>) some educational institutions such as the Polytechnic of Namibia realized the national aim of the Republic of Namibia to increase the number of SMEs; thereby, Namibians are encouraged to play a part and inspire young people at an earlier stage of their careers to change their mindsets and consider entrepreneurship as a viable career option. Primary school learners should also be encouraged, and should be informally exposed to entrepreneurial activities within their respective communities. It is also very important to highlight in this chapter that the informal sector in Namibia booms with entrepreneurial initiatives under a local bridge at Wernhill Park shopping. People make an effort to sell whatever they are able to in order to sustain their livelihoods and family. The next section of this chapter deals with entrepreneurial challenges in Namibia.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\"section\" id=\"sec_5\" data-lvl=\"1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<h2 class=\"heading main-title\">5. Challenges for Namibia in terms of entrepreneurial education</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p id=\"P21\">Although Namibia is working towards Vision 2030, the major challenge to get more people involved in the small and medium-sized business sector. When changing the mindset of people in Namibia, it requires full acceptance and incorporation (both at an individual and business sector level) of the business principles and fundamentals. This involves a paradigm shift of culture or attitude of taking up a job or any small business activity, even if it is only for subsistence reasons. This will require taking full ownership, exhibiting entrepreneurial behaviour and feeling challenged by one&rsquo;s own goals, rather than only having the desire to earn money. SMEs that fit in Namibia&rsquo;s economy would be of interest to new entrepreneurs if they have made a mind shift and have proven that they are competent before going into business. This will require aspiring entrepreneurs to become acquainted to business principles at a young age to take one step closer in a positive direction.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p id=\"P22\">Other challenges for Namibian entrepreneurs include attaining collateral from banks to start their business. Most people find themselves at the bottom of the pyramid in terms of income and so simply being able to start a business is a challenge for most citizens. The Republic of Namibia is a country with 11 different ethnic groups, and each of these groups has their own cultures and traditional belief systems. According to <a href=\"#B2\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">April (2009</a>) there are numerous cultural factors that prohibit even youth from entrepreneurial education. These are, amongst many others and not limited to young women usually being seen as housekeepers and having to get married and bear children for their husbands. Another critical challenge is that Namibian communities usually have large extended families, and even when people start an enterprise they mostly fail to follow the basic business principles, as family values hold precedence over business values. This can usually lead to closure of the business within the first few years of being established. It is the notion of some communities that entrepreneurship interferes with their traditional system, and that there could be a better manner through which they can be incorporated into the national economy.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\"section\" id=\"sec_6\" data-lvl=\"1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<h2 class=\"heading main-title\">6. Research methodology</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p id=\"P23\">Being exploratory in nature, this chapter aims to explore the spirit of entrepreneurial education in Namibia. The author used a qualitative research approach to write up this chapter. Qualitative research enabled the author to capture rich meaning from the responses of the audience. The author interviewed 50 respondents for this study. The sample constitutes both respondents in school, out of school and members of the community (see table below for the breakdown of respondents).</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<div class=\"table-wrap\" id=\"T1\"><div class=\"table-content\"><table margin-left=\"0\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<col width=\"232.8\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<col width=\"135.7\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<thead>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<td border-top=\"1\" border-bottom=\"1\" border-left=\"0\" border-right=\"0\" bgcolor=\"808080\" valign=\"center\" align=\"left\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<strong>Description</strong>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<td border-top=\"1\" border-bottom=\"1\" border-left=\"0\" border-right=\"0\" bgcolor=\"808080\" valign=\"center\" align=\"left\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<strong>Total</strong>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</thead>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<td border-top=\".5\" border-bottom=\".5\" border-left=\"0\" border-right=\"0\" valign=\"center\" align=\"left\">Youth in school</td>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<td border-top=\".5\" border-bottom=\".5\" border-left=\"0\" border-right=\"0\" valign=\"center\" align=\"left\">15</td>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<td border-top=\".5\" border-bottom=\".5\" border-left=\"0\" border-right=\"0\" valign=\"center\" align=\"left\">Youth out of school</td>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<td border-top=\".5\" border-bottom=\".5\" border-left=\"0\" border-right=\"0\" valign=\"center\" align=\"left\">15</td>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<td border-top=\".5\" border-bottom=\".5\" border-left=\"0\" border-right=\"0\" valign=\"center\" align=\"left\">Members of the community</td>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<td border-top=\".5\" border-bottom=\".5\" border-left=\"0\" border-right=\"0\" valign=\"center\" align=\"left\">20</td>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<td border-top=\".5\" border-bottom=\"1\" border-left=\"0\" border-right=\"0\" bgcolor=\"A6A6A6\" valign=\"center\" align=\"left\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<strong>TOTAL OF THE RESPONDENTS</strong>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<td border-top=\".5\" border-bottom=\"1\" border-left=\"0\" border-right=\"0\" bgcolor=\"A6A6A6\" valign=\"center\" align=\"left\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<strong>50</strong>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</td>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</tr>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</table></div><div class=\"table-caption\"><h3 class=\"heading\"></h3><div class=\"text\"></div><div class=\"text\"></div></div></div>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p id=\"P25\">Most youth in school are of the opinion that entrepreneurs are the lifeblood of the Namibian economy. For the Namibian economy to prosper, entrepreneurs will be needed now and in the future. The out-of-school youth felt entrepreneurship to have a very important role for the development of the Namibian economy while members of the community felt the same way. However, some respondents are of the opinion that the economy still faces many challenges and has a long way to go. The majority of the respondents felt that a change of mindset is not easy, while some of the young people were also struggling to come up with a perfect definition for entrepreneurial education. Some interviewees felt that entrepreneurship not only takes mindset into account, but that the right attitude is an essential quality for success. This could help the Namibian economy if those with the right attitude are guided to start their own businesses. Spotting academically gifted students and taking them through a rigorous mentorship programme could also foster a culture of entrepreneurship in Namibia. The interviewees also pointed out that the colonial past makes it difficult for them to live out entrepreneurship, especially those in rural remote Namibia. Some interviewees felt some business owners to lack motivation when starting up their own business. The majority of the respondents felt that entrepreneurship is not well promoted in Namibia. The way in which Namibians interpret entrepreneurship is different from the original perception of what entrepreneurship for a developing economy should entail, and many people in Namibia feel that starting a business is a viable option, but do not know how to start one. This will require a redesign of strategies and remedial ideas for future success. The next section of this chapter will look at conclusions, recommendations and the way forward for Namibia.</p>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t<div class=\"section\" id=\"sec_7\" data-lvl=\"1\">\\n\\t\\t\\t<h2 class=\"heading main-title\">7. Conclusions, recommendations and the way forward</h2>\\n\\t\\t\\t<p id=\"P26\">This chapter explored the role of entrepreneurial education in Namibia. It can be concluded that Namibians have a strong will in terms of entrepreneurial education, but the actual implementation of relevant programmes remains a challenge for the economy. It is clear from this chapter that entrepreneurship should be promoted on a much larger scale, and more extensively, in order to reach communities in Namibia. Youths should be exposed to business settings, to help them develop and foster the right attitude in order to develop entrepreneurial skills abilities and skills. A constant and deliberate effort should be made to educate Namibians more in entrepreneurship, and this can be done by taking the following points into consideration:</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t<ul><li><p id=\"P27\">Young pupils, starting from primary school, should be exposed to business concepts in order to develop the right mindset (skills and competencies to develop better).</p></li><li><p id=\"P28\">Successful integration of entrepreneurial education will also require patience and respect from the various ethnic groups who exist in Namibia.</p></li><li><p id=\"P29\">The theoretical components in the education curriculum should be balanced with practical work to develop competencies that will stimulate the entrepreneur.</p></li><li><p id=\"P30\">A Namibian who is already in business should be mentored to perform to the best of their ability and try to develop some competencies.</p></li><li><p id=\"P31\">Institutions of higher learning such as the University of Namibia, who offer courses in entrepreneurship, should help with convincing the nation that a mindset change is needed and the conditions need to be fulfilled.</p></li></ul>\\n\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\n',keywords:null,chapterPDFUrl:\"https://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/47638.pdf\",chapterXML:\"https://mts.intechopen.com/source/xml/47638.xml\",downloadPdfUrl:\"/chapter/pdf-download/47638\",previewPdfUrl:\"/chapter/pdf-preview/47638\",totalDownloads:2391,totalViews:3439,totalCrossrefCites:1,totalDimensionsCites:1,hasAltmetrics:1,dateSubmitted:\"April 17th 2014\",dateReviewed:\"August 31st 2014\",datePrePublished:null,datePublished:\"March 25th 2015\",readingETA:\"0\",abstract:null,reviewType:\"peer-reviewed\",bibtexUrl:\"/chapter/bibtex/47638\",risUrl:\"/chapter/ris/47638\",book:{slug:\"entrepreneurship-education-and-training\"},signatures:\"Wilfred Isak April\",authors:[{id:\"110034\",title:\"Dr.\",name:\"Wilfred\",middleName:\"Isak\",surname:\"April\",fullName:\"Wilfred April\",slug:\"wilfred-april\",email:\"drwilfredisakapril@gmail.com\",position:null,institution:{name:\"Charit\u00e9\",institutionURL:null,country:{name:\"Germany\"}}}],sections:[{id:\"sec_1\",title:\"1.

Introduction</h2><p id=\"p2\">During the recent decades, a number of remotely sensed rainfall products have been developed from satellites and are being used widely for different applications such as weather forecasting, hydrology and water resource management. The satellite rainfall data is also useful in assessing the large scale droughts [<a href=\"#B1\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">1</a>] and to monitor the extreme weather events which is increasing due to climate change [<a href=\"#B2\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">2</a>, <a href=\"#B3\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">3</a>]. The estimation of rainfall from satellites mainly depends upon the relationship between rain rate and the cloud top temperature, observed from the infrared sensors and the influence of rain drops on microwave radiation. The IR based techniques apply the empirical methods to obtain the rainfall from the cloud top brightness temperature, assuming the rainfall originates from the convective clouds [<a href=\"#B4\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">4</a>, <a href=\"#B5\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">5</a>]. On the other way, microwave techniques directly sense the radiation emission and scattering occurring due to presence of hydrometeors and provide the rainfall estimates. The lacuna in the two methods are IR technique fails in the case of warm clouds and MW measurements are with less frequency compared to IR passes [<a href=\"#B6\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">6</a>]. However, the combination of the two aforementioned techniques provide the best estimates of rainfall, which was employed in the retrieval algorithms of TRMM Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) and Climate Prediction Centre (CPC) morphing technique (CMORPH). The TRMM was launched as the joint effort of National Aeronautics and Space Agency (NASA), USA and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Japan to monitor and assess the tropical rainfall and associated latent heating [<a href=\"#B7\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">7</a>]. The main TRMM sensors are a TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI)], precipitation radar (PR) and a visible and infrared scanner (VIRS). These are combined variously with other IR and gauge-based products [<a href=\"#B8\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">8</a>]. The unique advantage with TRMM that it passes through all hours, thus the diurnal variation of rainfall can be studied. The 3-hourly data records of TRMM rainfall with 0.25 grid resolution are made available from the year 1998 to till 2013 and thereafter, the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), the improved version of TRMM which allowed to better link the data sets were been launched [<a href=\"#B9\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">9</a>]. Arrival of GPM brought revolutionary changes in the studying the rainfall characteristics of the convective systems, storms etc. Having with the high spatiotemporal resolution of 0.10 degree and half hourly precipitation products, the GPM rainfall estimates are proven to be more reliable to study the characteristics of tropical cyclones and other rainfall induced hazardous events [<a href=\"#B10\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">10</a>].</p><p id=\"p3\">Nevertheless, the satellite rainfall products cannot accurately estimate the rainfall. They are much helpful over large areas when there is a limited coverage of rain gauges which of their average may not represent the whole areal rainfall picture in terms of its variability and magnitude. Over small scale areas, the satellites show inability to capture the localized variations. Hence, it ought to validate the satellite rainfall with the ground based measurements of any area before is being used. Several studies focuses globally to validate the TMPA rainfall products not only with the ground based measurements but also with the existing reanalysis products and reported various issues among the comparison results. A study over Caspian Sea Region of Iran by Duan et&nbsp;al. [<a href=\"#B11\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">11</a>] showed that the TRMM 3B42 version rainfall data replicates the monthly and annual variations as gauge data. They also reported that TRMM underestimates the heavy rainfall events over Iran. Nair et&nbsp;al. [<a href=\"#B12\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">12</a>] showed that TRMM 3B42 V6 rainfall products were unable to estimate the accurate amount of orographic rainfall (over Western Ghats of India) and it was underestimated over the rain shadow regions. But the satellite is able to capture the rainfall gradient from west to east of Western Ghats region. It is also reported that the TRMM algorithm was unable to pick the average high and low daily rainfall over India [<a href=\"#B13\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">13</a>]. Uma et&nbsp;al. [<a href=\"#B14\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">14</a>] compared the TRMM 3B42 V6 rainfall data with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded data developed by [<a href=\"#B15\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">15</a>] from 1998 to 2007 and found that at 5&deg; &times; 5&deg; scales and beyond, both products are compatible to each other. The temporal scale assessment of them showed the pentads of TRMM rainfall (TMPA) are in good agreement with the IMD gridded rainfall data over India. Cao et&nbsp;al. [<a href=\"#B16\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">16</a>] performed the evaluation of 3B43 TRMM data with the ground measurements of rainfall over Yangtze River Delta of China during the period 1998&ndash;2016. The results of their study infer that 3B43 data overestimates the actual precipitation but maintained the consistency in terms of correlation and bias. The GPM which is the successor of TRMM offering half hourly rainfall products were also been validated over different regional scales. The comparison of GPM rainfall product IMERG (Integrated Multi satellite Retrievals for GPM) with TRMM 3B42 V7 products over southern Tibetan Plateau indicates the GPM outperforms the TRMM in all spatial scales [<a href=\"#B17\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">17</a>]. GPM shows better detecting capacity than TRMM during light rainy days. Preliminary results of assessment of GPM over India show the difficulties in detecting the rainfall events over south east peninsular and north eastern parts of India [<a href=\"#B18\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">18</a>]. Though there are numerous studies on the validation and comparison of TRMM, GPM rainfall amounts, studies on how satellite rainfall is able to capture the dominant periodicities and interannual variability caused by the global teleconnections such as El Ni&ntilde;o and La Ni&ntilde;a are sparse. The present work has been mainly focused on the consistency and ability of satellite (TRMM and GPM) in picking the interannual variations and dominant periodicities of Indian south west monsoon. The study on the periodical features of rainfall derived from the satellites are very important in understanding the large scale circulation patterns and have implications on the soil erosion where ground data is not available [<a href=\"#B19\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">19</a>]. Henceforth, we focus on the inter-annual variations and prevailing seasonal oscillations of Indian summer monsoon rainfall obtained from the TRMM/GPM and IMD gridded data sets for the period 1998&ndash;2017.</p></div><div class=\"section\" id=\"sec_2\" data-lvl=\"1\"><h2 class=\"heading main-title\">2. Data and methods</h2><p id=\"p4\">The daily rainfall data from TRMM 3B42 V7 for the period 1998&ndash;2013 has been used in the present study along with the IMERG data from 2014 to 2017. The TRMM data is available at 0.25&deg; &times; 0.25&deg; degree spatial resolution published by the Goddard Space Flight Centre Distributed Active Archive Centre (GSFC DAAC). IMERG half hourly data is available with 0.1&deg; &times; 0.1&deg; spatial resolutions and the same is considered from 2014 to 2017. Both the data sets have been averaged to 0.25&deg; &times; 0.25&deg; degree spatial resolution and used in the present study for the period from 1998 to 2017. The rainfall data has been extracted to the monsoon core region of India [<a href=\"#B20\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">20</a>] on daily basis and converted to monthly scales by cumulating the daily rainfall for the months of south west monsoon (June, July, August and September) for the period 1998&ndash;2017. Before the onset of southwest monsoon, the core monsoon region is characterized by a heat low and thereafter, establishment of a tropical convergence zone takes place in this region [<a href=\"#B21\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">21</a>]. The boundary from the heat low areas over the northwestern part of India to the moist convective parts of the eastern part of the monsoon zone also exhibit significant variation from year to year. The region has different characteristics during a poor and good monsoon years. The monsoon core region of India is shown in the <a href=\"#F1\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"fig\">Figure 1</a> and the rainfall data pertaining to this region is used for the present analysis.</p><figure class=\"media-panel\" id=\"F1\"><div class=\"media\"><img src=\"/media/chapter/66056/media/F1.png\" class=\"figure-link\" alt=\"\"></div><figcaption class=\"caption\"><h4>Figure 1.</h4><p>Monsoon core region of India and density of rain gauges over Indian land mass (source: [20, 22]).</p></figcaption></figure><p id=\"p6\">IMD gridded data with 0.25&deg; &times; 0.25&deg; spatial resolution spread over Indian land mass has been used as the ground validation in the present study. These data sets were developed by Pai et&nbsp;al. [<a href=\"#B22\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">22</a>] based on the rainfall record from 6955 rain gauges located in India. Out of 6955 rain gauges, 547 are from IMD; 494 from hydro-meteorology; 74 from agromet and remaining from the stations maintained by the state government India. The average number of stations used to obtain 1 day rainfall is about 3100. This version of data is known as IMD4 whereas the earlier versions of this data, IMD3, IMD3 and IMD1 are developed for the periods 1971&ndash;2005, 1901&ndash;2004 and 1951&ndash;2007 0.5&deg; &times; 0.5&deg; and 1&deg; &times; 1&deg; spatial resolutions over Indian landmass and 6076, 1380 and 2140 number of rain gauges were used.

Likewise, we computed the daily rainfall over the study region for the southwest monsoon months of June to September for the year from 1998 to 2017.

The average daily rainfall for the season is 6.89 and 7.64&nbsp;mm for IMD and satellite data sets with mean bias of 0.74&nbsp;mm. Both the data sets show the monsoon characteristics such as less rainfall during the onset of monsoon, establishment of monsoon during July and August months and weakening of monsoon during the end of September. The daily variability in satellite rainfall is found to be higher than IMD indicated by the respective standard deviations (2.14&nbsp;mm for IMD and 2.29&nbsp;mm for satellite). It is also observed that satellite is slightly over estimated the IMD rainfall. The linear association of both data sets was significant at 0.01 level with a correlation coefficient of 0.88. However, the correlation coefficient between IMD and satellite data sets varied year to year which is the indication of degree of good agreement in their magnitudes. The seasonal bias between IMD and satellite data sets over monsoon core region varied from &minus;2.6% (2001) to a maximum of 28% (2004) which shows the less bias when whole Indian land mass is considered. The study of Uma et&nbsp;al. [<a href=\"#B14\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">14</a>] on the validation of TMPA and IMD data sets report that TMPA under estimated the Indian rainfall about 100&nbsp;mm for the period 1998&ndash;2007 (10&nbsp;year mean rainfall for IMD and TMPA are 939 and 832&nbsp;mm respectively). But over the core region, the satellite data over estimated the IMD of about 90&nbsp;mm (20&nbsp;year mean rainfall for IMD and satellite are 841 and 932&nbsp;mm respectively). The percentage departures of IMD and satellite rainfall with respect to their long term averages are given in <a href=\"#F4\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"fig\">Figure 4</a>. By and large, the satellite is able to pick up the monsoon rainfall which is evidenced by its negative anomalies during the El Ni&ntilde;o years of 2009&ndash;2010 and 2015&ndash;2016 and positive anomalies during the La Ni&ntilde;a year 2010&ndash;2011 respectively.</p><figure class=\"media-panel\" id=\"F3\"><div class=\"media\"><img src=\"/media/chapter/66056/media/F3.png\" class=\"figure-link\" alt=\"\"></div><figcaption class=\"caption\"><h4>Figure 3.</h4><p>Mean daily rainfall of IMD and Satellite (TMPA and IMERG) for the period 1998&ndash;2017 over monsoon core region of India during the SW monsoon season.</p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"media-panel\" id=\"F4\"><div class=\"media\"><img src=\"/media/chapter/66056/media/F4.png\" class=\"figure-link\" alt=\"\"></div><figcaption class=\"caption\"><h4>Figure 4.</h4><p>Interannual variability of SW monsoon rainfall from IMD and Satellite data over monsoon core region of India.</p></figcaption></figure></div><div class=\"section\" id=\"sec_4_2\" data-lvl=\"2\"><h3 class=\"heading section-title\">3.2 Lomb Scargle Periodogram of IMD and satellite rainfall to study ISO features</h3><p id=\"p20\">Lomb Scargle Periodogram (LSP) is a well known technique used to detect the periodic signals of given data by generating the power spectrum. The advantage of LSP is that can be applied for non-uniform and uniform data sets. When the data sets are uniform, the LSP turns to classical and in the case of non-uniform samples, it takes the Scargle generalized form of periodogram [<a href=\"#B23\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">23</a>].

Kishore et&nbsp;al. [<a href=\"#B24\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">24</a>] studied the precipitation of IMD for a period of 107&nbsp;years from 1901 to 2007 using LSP and found different periodicities of 10, 15.7, 23 and 33&nbsp;years with different confidence intervals. The LSP of northeast monsoon rainfall (October to December) over peninsular Indian region indicating the 20 and 30&ndash;40&nbsp;days periodicity [<a href=\"#B25\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">25</a>]. Since, the LSP is most useful in portraying the periodicities of a season; the applicability of LSP during the south west monsoon season of Indian region will give more insight to understand the dominant ISO of southwest monsoon. In the present work, we have performed the LSP for the daily rainfall data averaged over monsoon core region of India (<a href=\"#F1\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"fig\">Figure 1</a>) for the period 1998&ndash;2017 for IMD as well as for satellite rainfall data sets respectively (<a href=\"#F5\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"fig\">Figure 5</a>). From the <a href=\"#F5\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"fig\">Figure 5</a>, we see the peaks of normalized power for different periodicities during the SW monsoon season. Wherever, the dominant periodicities are captured by IMD as well as satellite. It is well known that the dominant periodicities of Indian SW monsoon are (i) a 30&ndash;60&nbsp;days oscillation, known as Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO). It is one of the tropical weather phenomena moves eastward and changes the rainfall pattern over Indian latitudes based on its arrival, (ii) oscillations having periodicity less than 20, viz., monsoon trough, tropical easterly jet, moist static stability, monsoon cloud cover, break and wet spells [<a href=\"#B26\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">26</a>]. The overall observation of <a href=\"#F5\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"fig\">Figure 5</a> suggests that the normalized power is high for the higher periodicities and is depicted by the both data sets. Two major peaks were observed during the 30&ndash;60&nbsp;days MJO oscillations, one is at 40 (slightly less than) and the other is in between 50 and 60. These peaks are the representatives of strong cycles of MJO which has great impact on Indian summer monsoon. When comes to periodicities less than 20&nbsp;days which are mainly known to be localized variations were also captured by both IMD and satellites. Here we find the dominant periodicities at 20 and 7&nbsp;days. However, the magnitude of normalized power during the individual years varies from satellite to IMD data sets. For this purpose, we show the LSP for the 2 years 2010 (La Ni&ntilde;a) and 2015 (El Ni&ntilde;o) where the monsoon core region experienced 15 and &minus;11% of its normal seasonal rainfall (1998&ndash;2017) (<a href=\"#F6\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"fig\">Figure 6a</a> and <a href=\"#F6\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"fig\">b</a>). Satellite rainfall also show the similar fluctuations as IMD rainfall showed. The LSPs of 2011 and 2015 show different features though both capture the dominant periodicities. The normalized power of IMD rainfall did not vary much when compared with the satellite derived rainfall for the years 2011 and 2015. The magnitudes of normalized power of satellite show the suppressed activity of MJO in the year and 2015 and the pronounced activity during the year 2011. It is reported that the suppressed phase of MJO in the Indian Ocean causes the lower rainfall amounts when there is no deep convection [<a href=\"#B27\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">27</a>]. Also, when the MJO is strong, higher temperature anomalies observed over lower troposphere altitudes and cooler air prevails in the upper troposphere which brings the more instability. During the presence of El Ni&ntilde;o, the easterlies of the equatorial north Indian Ocean weakens the monsoon westerlies and in the case of La Ni&ntilde;a, the westerly anomalies strengthen the monsoon winds. Hence, one may expect higher power of MJO in the rainfall pattern during the La Ni&ntilde;a and lower power in the El Ni&ntilde;o [<a href=\"#B28\" class=\"ref-link\" data-ref-style=\"bibr\">28</a>]. The same features were picked better by the satellite rainfall compared to IMD rainfall. As the MJO is the combination of cloud and precipitation processes, the satellite is being advantageous as it measures rainfall from the cloud properties whereas the IMD measurements are based on the ground measurements. However, as mentioned earlier, the dominant features of ISO are well captured by the satellite as the ground observations.</p><figure class=\"media-panel\" id=\"F5\"><div class=\"media\"><img src=\"/media/chapter/66056/media/F5.png\" class=\"figure-link\" alt=\"\"></div><figcaption class=\"caption\"><h4>Figure 5.</h4><p>LSP of daily SW monsoon rainfall of IMD and satellite for the period 1998&ndash;2017.</p></figcaption></figure><figure class=\"media-panel\" id=\"F6\"><div class=\"media\"><img src=\"/media/chapter/66056/media/F6.png\" class=\"figure-link\" alt=\"\"></div><figcaption class=\"caption\"><h4>Figure 6.</h4><p>(a and b) LSP of daily SW monsoon rainfall of IMD and satellite for the La Nino year 2011 and for the El Nina year 2015.</p></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class=\"section\" id=\"sec_6\" data-lvl=\"1\"><h2 class=\"heading main-title\">4. Conclusions</h2><p id=\"p25\">Main features of Indian south west monsoon were studied using the IMD and Satellite rainfall data sets. Satellite rainfall data sets show very less bias with relation to the IMD over the monsoon core region of India for the period 1998&ndash;2017. The interannual variability of satellite derived rainfall could show the impact of global teleconnections such as El Ni&ntilde;o and La Ni&ntilde;a evidenced by the negative and positive anomalies of rainfall from their respective means respectively. The LSP of averaged daily rainfall of IMD and satellite pick up the similar features of ISO such as Madden Julian Oscillation (30&ndash;60&nbsp;days) and localized periodicities (less than 20&nbsp;days). The normalized power of LSP varies from year to year from IMD to satellite rainfall, which shows the different behavior of satellite in detecting the ISO.&nbsp;During the El Ni&ntilde;o and La Ni&ntilde;a years, satellite rainfall could show better features than IMD when the normalized power is being considered. Overall, the satellite rainfall data sets over monsoon core region offer a valuable data sets with less bias and good agreement.</p></div><div class=\"section\" id=\"sec_7\" data-lvl=\"1\"><h2 class=\"heading main-title\">Acknowledgments</h2><p id=\"p260\">The second author H.

The validation uses the data sets covering the 20\u00a0years (1998\u20132017) and detects the time series bias; inter annual variations and Intra Seasonal Oscillations (ISO). The bias in the two data sets is found to be very less over the core region compared to whole India. The correlation between daily rainfall IMD and satellite is found to be +0.88 which is of 99% confidence level. The dominant periodicities in the rainfall patterns of IMD and satellite are Madden Julie Oscillation (30\u201360\u00a0days) and local oscillations (less than 20\u00a0days) are conspicuous and the normalized power varies from year to year.

The lubrication plays a significant role in CMP and can be determined by the Stribeck curve since it provides direct evidence of the extent of contact among wafer, pad asperities, and slurry particles. The advancements in the construction of the Stribeck curve are highlighted in this chapter. Traditionally, the procedure for constructing the Stribeck curve is as follows: (1) polish wafers at various pressures and sliding velocities to obtain the coefficient of friction (COF) values; (2) plot the experimental data as COF vs. Sommerfeld number; (3) construct the Stribeck curve via curve fitting. Recently, an alternative method was presented to construct the Stribeck curve via only performing one wafer polishing experiment. Pressure and sliding velocity are varied separately or together for a desired length of time, so that multiple measurements can be taken within one run. In this study, a back-propagation (BP) neural network is proposed to construct the Stribeck curve. Results show that the BP neural network could construct a more accurate Stribeck curve and thus could better provide insight into the lubrication mechanism of CMP processes.\",signatures:\"Changhong Wu and Xiaoyan Liao\",authors:[{id:\"182998\",title:\"Dr.\",name:\"Xiaoyan\",surname:\"Liao\",fullName:\"Xiaoyan Liao\",slug:\"xiaoyan-liao\",email:\"xiaoyan@email.arizona.edu\"},{id:\"183709\",title:\"Dr.\",name:\"Changhong\",surname:\"Wu\",fullName:\"Changhong Wu\",slug:\"changhong-wu\",email:\"chwu@email.arizona.edu\"}],book:{title:\"Advances in Tribology\",slug:\"advances-in-tribology\",productType:{id:\"1\",title:\"Edited Volume\"}}}],collaborators:[{id:\"151052\",title:\"Dr.\",name:\"Hannes\",surname:\"Allmaier\",slug:\"hannes-allmaier\",fullName:\"Hannes Allmaier\",position:null,profilePictureURL:\"//cdnintech.com/web/frontend/www/assets/author.svg\",biography:null,institutionString:null,institution:null},{id:\"151317\",title:\"Mr.\",name:\"David\",surname:\"Sander\",slug:\"david-sander\",fullName:\"David Sander\",position:\"Researcher\",profilePictureURL:\"//cdnintech.com/web/frontend/www/assets/author.svg\",biography:null,institutionString:null,institution:null},{id:\"178441\",title:\"Dr.\",name:\"David\",surname:\"Johnson\",slug:\"david-johnson\",fullName:\"David Johnson\",position:null,profilePictureURL:\"https://mts.intechopen.com/storage/users/178441/images/5646_n.jpg\",biography:\"David W.
